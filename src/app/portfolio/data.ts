        "I'm a creative developer with 10+ years of experience. I am a dreamer, a tinkerer, and a perpetual student.  I'm the type of person that doesn't let not knowing how to do something get in the way of bringing an idea to fruition. Precisely the opposite. I was the design student who wasn't satisfied with just comping my ideas, but had to figure out how to make them real, and next thing I know I found myself writing code everyday.",
        "I love exploring the intersection of design, technology, and the physical world, and Block's mission to create products that increase access and independence for eveyone appears to live right at this place. The role of the Proto team seems exactly like what I am seeking for the next phase of my career. I believe I have a unique skillset to bring the table. Thank you for taking the time to consider my portfolio, and I look forward to learning more about what you guys are working on.",

                "Most recently, the majority of my work was focused on building a CMS / publishing tool that allowed non-technical employees to build complete pages with the level of detail and finesse you would expect from an Apple website.  This involved creating a suite of components, that could be configured to work in many different contexts, support advanced animations, and guaranteed to adhere to our design system as well as our performance, accessibility, and seo standards.",

As a relatively new concept, there is no full featured tool for designing these drone shows, and they were experiencing some serious bottlenecks in their production workflow that involved using many pieces of software, to design, optimize and deploy the flight instructions that drones would eventually use. A lot of the challenges they were describing to me sounded familiar other creative coding I have done in the past with 3d graphics and partical systems.",
